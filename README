(0) what is this

    an animation and painting application.

(1) how to build/run:

    WINDOWS
    -------

    - visual studio settings:

            - make sure the following libraries are available:

                  WINTAB.h - header only
                  SDL2
                  SDL_image 2.0
                  GLEW

    To generate the resources required to render the UI, you'll require 
    an installation of imageMagick and python 2.7. cd into the ui-gen directory 
    and run: 

             python ui_gen.py
    
    to generate the images.

    LINUX
    -----

    - I have compiled with gcc succesfully under linux but the source may not 
    remain compatible as I'm primarily doing my development with the microsoft 
    vstudio express compilers. 

    There is no tablet support under linux presently.
      

(2) project-data:

    Frame pngs and the keyframe index file are stored in the project-data/ 
    folder.

    You can delete the keyframe_idx file to create a new project.

    If you export your data, it will be placed in project-data/export/ folder

(3) usage:

    The program will use the first available plugged in tablet it can find.
    
    If it cannot find a tablet, it will run in an emulation mode and you can
    draw with the mouse.

    KEYBOARD COMMANDS
    -----------------

        Q     - Move frame cursor left
        E     - Move frame cursor right
        
        1     - Edit background layer
        2     - Edit foreground layer
        
        K    - Insert keyframe on active layer
        D    - Delete keyframe on active layer
        
        R    - Toggle keyframe recording (automatically inserts keyframes on 
              active layer when navigating)
        
        C     - Switch primary/secondary colors in brush editor
        TAB   - Toggle UI on/off
        
        S    - Save project data
        X    - Export project data as png sequence
        
        Y    - Yank Current active layer/keyframe to buffer
        P    - Put buffer to current keyframe
        
        0    - Animation preview
        
        SPACE - Drag UI panels 
        
        ESC - Exit
    
(4) node brushes / special keys

    ** WORK IN PROGRESS **

    Brushes are a series of nodes with data flowing out from the stylus,
    through nodes, and then into the brush controller which performs rendering
    to the active drawing context.

    CTRL+Click will add data points inside node editors (e.g. gradient, mapper)

    ALT+Click removes data points.
