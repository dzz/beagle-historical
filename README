(0) what is this

    an animation and painting application.

(1) how to build/run:

    WINDOWS
    -------

    - visual studio settings:

            - include dir set to find the following headers:
                    WINTAB.H
                    SDL.H
                    SDL_image.h

            - libs dir to find:
                    SDL2.lib
                    SDL2main.lib
                    SDL2_image.lib

            - linker subsystem: console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

            - executable in same directory as this file

            - following DLLs in executable directory:
                    SDL2.dll
                    SDL2_image.dll
                    libjpeg-9.dll
                    libpng16-16.dll
                    libtiff-5.dll
                    libwebp-4.dll
                    zlib1.dll


    To generate the resources required to render the UI, you'll require 
    an installation of imageMagick and python 2.7. cd into the ui-gen directory 
    and run: 

             python ui_gen.py
    
    to generate the images.

    LINUX
    -----

    - I have compiled with gcc succesfully under linux but the source may not 
    remain compatible with gcc as I'm primarily doing my development with the
    microsoft compilers. There is no tablet support under linux presently.
      

(2) project-data:

    Frame pngs and the keyframe index file are stored in the project-data/ 
    folder.

    You can delete the keyframe_idx file to create a new project.

    If you export your data, it will be placed in project-data/export/ folder

(3) usage:

    The program will use the first available plugged in tablet it can find.
    
    If it cannot find a tablet, it will run in an emulation mode and you can
    draw with the mouse.
