an obscurely named animation and painting tool  

1) how to build/run:

*Requires a WINTAB (e.g. Wacom) compatible tablet

This can be built with Visual Studio 2012 express, and has been succesfully
compiled with GCC via Code::Blocks. 

The binary should be run with the working directory the same as this source
tree. You'll need the SDL and SDL_Image/associated (libpng etc.) dlls in 
your system or working folder.

No guarantees that included binary will work. 

2) project-data:

Frame pngs and the keyframe index file are stored in the project-data/ folder.
You can delete the keyframe_idx file to create a new project.

If you export your data, it will be placed in project-data/export/ folder

3) usage:

Q     - Move frame cursor left
E     - Move frame cursor right

1     - Edit background layer
2     - Edit foreground layer

K    - Insert keyframe on active layer
D    - Delete keyframe on active layer

R    - Toggle keyframe recording (automatically inserts keyframes on 
      active layer when navigating 

C     - Switch primary/secondary colors in brush editor
TAB   - Toggle UI on/off

S    - Save project data
X    - Export project data as png sequence

ESC - Exit

4) build/run resources:

You'll need the DLLs from these projects to run

SDL 2.0
http://www.libsdl.org/

SDL_image 2.0
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/


Wintab SDK is required to build, however if you have a Wacom tablet,
the libraries should already be installed on your system.
