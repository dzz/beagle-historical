an obscurely named animation and painting tool  

1) how to build/run:

This can be built with Visual Studio 2012 express, and has been succesfully
compiled with GCC via Code::Blocks. 

The binary should be run with the working directory the same as this source
tree. You'll need the SDL and SDL_Image/associated (libpng etc.) dlls in 
your system or working folder.

2) project-data:

Frame pngs and the keyframe index file are stored in the project-data/ folder.
You can delete the keyframe_idx file to create a new project.

If you export your data, it will be placed in project-data/export/ folder

3) usage:

The program will use the first available plugged in tablet it can find.

If it cnanot find a tablet, it will run in tablet-emulation mode and you can
draw with the mouse.

Q     - Move frame cursor left
E     - Move frame cursor right

1     - Edit background layer
2     - Edit foreground layer

K    - Insert keyframe on active layer
D    - Delete keyframe on active layer

R    - Toggle keyframe recording (automatically inserts keyframes on 
      active layer when navigating 

C     - Switch primary/secondary colors in brush editor
TAB   - Toggle UI on/off

S    - Save project data
X    - Export project data as png sequence

Y	 - Yank Current active layer/keyframe to buffer
P    - Put buffer to current keyframe

0    - Animation preview

SPACE - Drag UI panels 

ESC - Exit

4) build/run resources:

To generate the UI images, you'll need python and imagemagick,
run the ui_gen.py script from within that directory

You'll need the DLLs from these projects to run

SDL 2.0
http://www.libsdl.org/

SDL_image 2.0
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

Wintab SDK is required to build, however if you have a Wacom tablet,
the libraries should already be installed on your system.

WINTAB SDK
